Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
===

Summary
---

For Assignment 1 in CS480X I decided to make a a graph using California Covid Hospitalization data using the months March and December of 2021. Utilizing d3 and javascript I was able to plot this data using lines, circles, polygons(pendagon and triangle), and rectangles. I also used different colors for different shapes/lines on the graph. The API for d3 was very nice and intuitive to use for these graphs.
